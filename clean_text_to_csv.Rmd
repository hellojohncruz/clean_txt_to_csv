## Introduction

The objective is to import a text file containing the results of a chess tournament, extract the information needed, and export to a CSV file that could be used in a database.

| player_name       | player's full name      |
| player_state      | player's state                |
| total_pts       | total points           |
| pre-rating       | player's pre-rating entering the tournament    |

## Required Libraries

```{r library, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

---

## Read Text File



```{r read-text_file, warning=FALSE}

df <- data.frame()

con = file('data.txt', "r")
while (TRUE) {
  line = readLines(con, n = 1)
  
  if (length(line) == 0) {
     break
  }
  
  df <- bind_rows(df, data.frame(line))
}
close(con)

```

---

## Drop Non-Alphanumeric Rows

``` {r drop-non-alphanumeric-rows}

# find rows that has alpha-numeric characters
for (row in df){
  df$str_alpha <- str_detect(row, '[a-zA-Z0-9]')
}

# drop non-alpha-numeric rows
df_alpha_num <- df %>% 
  filter(., str_alpha == TRUE) %>%
  select(., line)

# drop first two rows containing header info
df_alpha_num <- df_alpha_num %>%
  slice(-c(1, 2))

```

---

## Extract Player Data

``` {r extract-player-data, message=FALSE}
# create empty dataframe
player_df <- data.frame()

# loop through each row 
for (i in seq(1, nrow(df_alpha_num), by = 2)){
  
  # read every odd row for player id, name and total points
  row_info <- str_split_fixed(df_alpha_num[i, ],regex("|", literal=TRUE),n=Inf)
  df_temp <- data.frame(row_info)
  temp_cols <- c("player_id", "player_name", "total_pts", "round_1", "round_2", "round_3", "round_4", "round_5", "round_6", "round_7")
  colnames(df_temp) = temp_cols
  df_export <- df_temp %>% 
      select(1:10)
  
  # read every even row to add additional columns for player info state and pre-rating
  row_info <- str_split_fixed(df_alpha_num[i+1, ],regex("|", literal=TRUE),n=Inf)
  df_temp <- data.frame(row_info)
  temp_cols <- c("player_state", "pre_rating")
  colnames(df_temp) = temp_cols
  df_export <- bind_cols(df_export, df_temp %>% 
      select(1:2))
  
  # extract individual player info to all players dataframe
  player_df <- bind_rows(player_df, df_export)
}
```

---

## Clean Strings

``` {r find-opponents}
for (i in 4:10){
  player_df[, i] <- gsub("[^0-9]", "", player_df[, i])
}
```

``` {r find-pre-rating}
player_df <- player_df %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(pre_rating, delim = ": ", names = c('rtg_1', 'rtg_2'))

player_df$pre_rating <- player_df$rtg_2 %>% parse_number()
```

``` {r trim-whitespace}
player_df <- player_df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim))
```

``` {r change-data-types}
change_type <- c("player_id", "total_pts", "round_1", "round_2", "round_3", "round_4", "round_5", "round_6", "round_7", "pre_rating")
player_df <- player_df %>% 
  mutate_at(change_type, as.numeric)
```

---

## Determine Opponents Average Pre-Ratings

``` {r replace-opponents-with-pre-rating}
for (i in 1:nrow(player_df)){
  for (j in 4:10){
    if (!is.na(player_df[[i,j]])){
      player_df[i,j] <- player_df %>% 
        filter(., player_id == player_df[[i, j]]) %>% 
        select(pre_rating)
    }
  }
}
```

``` {r calculate-avg-opp-pre-rating}
player_df <- player_df %>% 
  mutate(avg_opp_rating = round(rowMeans(pick(round_1:round_7), na.rm=TRUE), 2))
```

---

## Export to CSV

``` {r export_csv}
export_df <- player_df %>% 
  select(-c(1, 4:10, 12, 13)) %>% 
  select(c(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)) 

write_csv(export_df, 'chess_players.csv')
```
